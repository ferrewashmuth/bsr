By prioritizing community input, equity, and sustainability in the planning and development of community gardens, we can create thriving green spaces that nourish both people and the planet.<\/p>\n<p>Community gardens are living expressions of resilience, cooperation, and care, where people come together to cultivate health, connection, and sustainability. As we tend to these green oases in our neighborhoods, let us nurture the seeds of community, sow the fruits of collaboration, and reap the harvest of a healthier, more vibrant, and equitable future for all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In neighborhoods across urban and suburban landscapes, community gardens are sprouting up as vibrant hubs of activity, fostering health, connection, and sustainability.
