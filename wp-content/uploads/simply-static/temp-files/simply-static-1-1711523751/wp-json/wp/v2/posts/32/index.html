Young activists are demanding ambitious climate policies, investment in renewable energy, protection of biodiversity, and justice for communities disproportionately affected by climate change, such as indigenous peoples and frontline communities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Educating and Mobilizing:<\/strong> In addition to mobilizing for action, young activists are working to educate and empower their peers and communities to become agents of change. Through workshops, educational events, and digital campaigns, students are raising awareness about the impacts of climate change, sharing strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation, and building solidarity across diverse communities and backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Global Solidarity and Collaboration:<\/strong> Youth-led climate action is a truly global movement, with young people from every corner of the globe coming together to demand climate justice.
